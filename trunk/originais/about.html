<h1>About the Author</h1>

<p><img src='images/shark_warning.jpg'></p>

<p>Albert Sweigart (but you can call him Al), is a software developer in San Francisco, California who enjoys bicycling, reading, volunteering, network security, haunting coffee shops, and making useful software.</p>

<p>He is originally from Houston, Texas. He finally put his University of Texas at Austin computer science degree in a frame. He is a friendly introvert, a cat person, and fears that he is losing brain cells over time. He laughs out loud when watching park squirrels, and people think he’s a simpleton.</p>

<p>His website and blog are located at http://coffeeghost.net</p>
